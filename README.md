# LED Strips
This is just a place to dump info and ideas about the LED strips that arrived at NYCR. Ideally I'd like to resuse the controller boards that came with them.

I've started documenting the controller board. The LED boards are a series of warm white, cool white, and RGB leds driven by daisy-chained MY9221 chips.
